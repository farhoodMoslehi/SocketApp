This socket application was originally designed for a uDeploy application.
But it can be altered to work with any process on a linux environments.
The basic premise of the application is that once a process goes down on one 
server, a message is sent to a standby server which brings a similar process up.
There is also a light weight web service which monitors which server is in the
Active mode.
Please refer to the documentation for detailed discussion.
